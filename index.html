                <p>Cancer insurance pays benefits to help pay for some of the direct medical and indirect non-medical costs related to cancer diagnosis and treatment. It can help pay for expenses that your health plan isn't designed to cover, like deductibles, coinsurance and travel to and from cancer treatment cents. Most plans offer options to help protect your spouse or children, as well.</p>
