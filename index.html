            <p>More isn't always better. When it comes to understanding insurance, there are really just five pieces of information you should know: what it is, what it covers, what it costs, what it will pay out and what it may exclude.</p>

                <p>Cancer insurance pays benefits to help pay for some of the direct medical and indirect non-medical costs related to cancer diagnosis and treatment. It can help pay for expenses that your health plan isn't designed to cover, like deductibles, coinsurance and travel to and from cancer treatment cents. Most plans offer options to help protect your spouse or children, as well.</p>

                <p>Injury prone? Weekend warrior? Have children who play sports? When an unexpected injury happens, accident insurance can help offset costs that are not covered by your medical plan. The benefit is paid directly to you and can be used for out-of-pocket costs like co-pays, deductibles, and other expenses. </p>
